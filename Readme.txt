1. The main index.html file is inside  the app folder. Please open it in Firefox Browser.
2. I have created a service for AJAX calls to retrieve posts and users. It is inside app->services->queryService.js
3. The resources folder contains css styles app->resources->styles.css
4. I have placed the header and the body inside a single angular component. The search is placed on the header. the search bar and header bar have been created using angular material.
5. Since I had to display 4 different fields, I thought using table would be the best way to display them. I have created table using simple html as there was no angular material available for that.
6. For filtering, I have used the inbuilt AngularJs filter.
